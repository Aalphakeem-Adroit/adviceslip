# Frontend Mentor - Advice generator app solution

This project is an Advice Generator Website designed as part of a challenge from [Advice generator app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/advice-generator-app-QdUG-13db). The site fetches random advice from the AdviceSlip API and displays it dynamically. With a simple and clean design, users can generate new pieces of advice by clicking a button. This project focuses on API integration, responsive design, and providing a user-friendly interface.
